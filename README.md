# LBM-code

## Overview
This directory is a LBM code. Here we are implementing a LBM code using python language.

## Description
The LBM code implemented here aims to simulate fluid flow in a two-dimensional domain. It employs the LBM algorithm, which discretizes the fluid into a lattice of cells and models the fluid behavior through the evolution of probability distribution functions (PDFs). The code follows a two-step process: collision and propagation.

1. **Collision**: In this step, the code calculates the equilibrium PDFs based on the local fluid variables (density and velocity). It then performs a collision operation to update the PDFs according to a relaxation time parameter.

2. **Propagation**: After collision, the code propagates the updated PDFs to neighboring cells based on predefined lattice velocities.

## Usage
To run the LBM code, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies (if any) mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. Set the simulation parameters such as grid resolution, average density, collision timescale, and number of timesteps in the code.
3. Run the code and observe the simulation results.

## File Structure
The file structure of this directory is organized as follows:

- `lbm_code.py`: The main Python script containing the LBM implementation.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the LBM code.
- `requirements.txt`: A text file listing the required dependencies, if any.
